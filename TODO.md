# Core

- [ ] PointBuffer
    - [x] InterleavedPointBuffer
        - [ ] Figure out ways of accessing the point data in known (but variable) formats, such as the 11 LAS formats
    - [x] PerAttributePointBuffer
        - [x] Improve `push_attribute` and `push_attribute_range` by using the builder pattern
    - [x] Support iterator `collect`
        - [ ] `From<[T;N]>` is not possible at the moment because it requires support for const generics
    - [x] Extension traits with generic point/attribute accessors 
        - [x] `PointBufferExt`
        - [x] `PointBufferMutExt`
        - [x] `InterleavedPointBufferExt`
        - [x] `InterleavedPointBufferMutExt`
        - [x] `PerAttributePointBufferExt`
        - [x] `PerAttributePointBufferMutExt`
- [ ] Point Views
    - [x] Interleaved view
    - [x] PerAttribute view
    - [ ] Performance checks on views for different PointBuffers
    - [ ] Attribute iterators using macro_rules!
        - [x] v1
        - [ ] Extensive tests
- [ ] PointType
    - [x] Basic `PointType` structure
    - [x] Procedural macro for implementing `PointType` for a type
        - [ ] Check robustness on types that are `#[repr(packed)]` but not `#[repr(C)]`
        - [x] Documentation of the `BUILTIN_...` and `attribute = "..."` syntax
        - [x] Get rid of warnings, clean up code
    - [ ] Can we support `Option<T>` for `T: PrimitiveType`? This could make it easier to work with data such as LAS where there are different runtime formats
- [ ] Examples of usage
- [ ] Documentation 
    - [x] Module-level documentation is missing 
    - [ ] Check for consistent naming and linking in docs, i.e. using 'the associated XYZ' and properly linking to types
    - [ ] Include some explanatory pictures for the memory layouts. Should be possible by including HTML
    - [ ] Provide more examples in docs and add `Examples` header prior to examples (by adding `# Examples`)
    - [x] Documentation of `points` iterators is wrong
- [ ] Find better names for the different point buffer flavors. `InterleavedVecPointStorage` is quite a mouthful...

        - [x] Format 10
        - [x] Attribute conversions (e.g. positions as I32, F32, F64)
            - [ ] Works in principle, but requires many more tests to be robust 
        - [x] SeekToPoint
            - [x] Tests
    - [ ] Writer
        - [x] Migrate `LASWriter` to use `RawLASWriter` and `RawLAZWriter`
            - [x] Implement `RawLAZWriter`
                - [x] Default format

        - [ ] Format 10
        - [ ] Attribute conversions (e.g. positions as I32, F32, F64)
        - [ ] SeekToPoint
            - [ ] Support SeekToPoint in Writer? 
        - [ ] Writing less than `chunk_size` (i.e. 50k) Points in `LASWriter::write` is quite slow (for example calling `write` with a buffer containing one point multiple times in a loop). Part of this might be the allocation of an internal buffer for `chunk_size` points inside `write`
    - [ ] Metadata
        - [x] Basic metadata structure
        - [ ] Support for additional attributes in header
        - [ ] Support for VLRs
            - [ ] Define how VLRs should be represented 
    - [x] Benchmarks
        - [x] Basic benchmarks for LAS and LAZ with default and custom format
        - [ ] Extend the benchmarks for more point layouts
